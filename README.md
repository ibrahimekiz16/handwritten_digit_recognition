The project consists of three main files: ml_model.py and mnist_pyqt5.py train_mnist_model.py.
When developing the code, I first created the file to train the code. By running this file, I automatically obtained an ML model file trained with the given dataset. 
Then, I used Python-based pyqt5 for the interface.
Finally, I created the main application of the project using the trained ML model in the ml_model.py file. 
After all this, I ran the mnist_pyqt5.py file to run the code using three different files in a single file.
I then ran the program to predict handwritten numbers using artificial intelligence.
